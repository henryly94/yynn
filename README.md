A neural network framework in C++.

This framework comes from homework. By the time I finished the neural network using numpy as scipy in Python, I felt like to implementing one neural network by myself. So there it is!.


This framework has features like:

- Slow

- Lame usage

- Bad runtime speed

But I am working on that! Give me a star and get updated!
